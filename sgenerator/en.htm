    <br>
    <p>This application turns your mobile phone into a powerful handheld dual-channel signal generator for generating sound signals (professionals can also be used to generate audio electric signals).</p>
    <p>Signal types include: sine wave, triangle wave, sawtooth wave, rectangular wave, Gaussian noise, Rayleigh noise, gamma noise, salt and pepper noise, uniformly distributed noise, pink noise, red (brown) noise, blue noise, purple noise, most Long sequence signal and sweep frequency signal.</p>
    <p>You can switch between single-channel or dual-channel operation; dual-channel can independently set the waveform and its parameters.</p>
    <p>You can adjust the signal's amplitude, frequency, and phase parameters.</p>
    <p>The waveform can be zoomed and zoomed freely with gestures or buttons, which is simple and easy to use.</p>
    <p>Support interface color selection.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This application is normally used to generate sound signals without any risk.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Special instructions for circuit measurement:</p>
    <p>Professionals can use this application for circuit measurement, and the audio signal is output through the left and right channels of the earphone.</p>
    <p>Please pay attention to safety: you must have sufficient professional knowledge, and high-voltage circuits must be equipped with isolation equipment.</p>
    <p>Circuit measurement is risky. The author of this application will not be responsible for any personnel or equipment losses caused by any correct or incorrect use of this application.</p>
