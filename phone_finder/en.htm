    <h2>AI Phone Finder</h2>
    <p>AI Phone Finder is a tool application that helps user quickly find a phone that is behind an object and not easily to be found.</p>
    <p>We often encounter situations where we don't know where we put the phone. It may be covered by something and will not be found for a while. With this app, the situation has changed a lot: when you can't find your phone, just shout to it, the phone will automatically answer you. The response sound will gradually increase, which can be heard even if it is under a quilt. When you pick up your phone, the answer will stop automatically.</p>
    <p>By collecting and saving user's voice samples, the application can compare with the voice of the user which will waken the phone through advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, and only responds to the awakening of the phone owner himself.</p>
