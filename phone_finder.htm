    <h2>AI Phone Finder Support Page</h2>
    <p>AI Phone Finder is a tool application that helps users quickly find a phone that is behind an object and not easily found. The application collects and saves the user's voice sample, and intelligently compares with the voice when the user calls the mobile phone to determine whether the user is looking for the mobile phone and then responds.</p>
    <p>This application collects user voice samples and samples the voice in real time. However, all voice data is only used to wake up the phone to answer user calls and will never be used for other purposes. This application does not connect to the network, does not require any user identity information, and will never reveal user privacy.</p>
